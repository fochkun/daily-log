# dailydev

> A lightweight, project-local journal for developers.  
> Track your deep work, insights, and progress — right inside your codebase.

No more "I can't start". No more lost context.  
Just run one command, and your daily log is ready — with a clean template, dated structure, and zero config.

Perfect for devs who:
- Work on multiple projects
- Need to re-enter context fast
- Prefer structured notes over chaotic tabs
- Commit everything (or nothing!) — you decide

## ✨ Quick Start

From any project directory:

```bash
npx dailydev init      # creates .daily/ with template & index
npx dailydev create    # creates today's journal: .daily/2026/01/2026-01-15.md
